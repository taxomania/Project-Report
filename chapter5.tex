\chapter{Results}
\label{cha:results}
This chapter details the results of the project, in terms of the accuracy of the feature extraction, along with views of the user interface.

\section{Feature Extraction}
The analysis of results is a semi-automated process carried out by checking which tweets were said to contain software and which did not. In total, 3268 tweets were retrieved from Twitter and stored in the MySQL database. These have all been through the feature extraction process, and 1168 of these are said to mention software or operating systems, leaving 2100 that do not. Of these tweets, roughly 10\%, i.e. 350, were manually tagged purely with software names, for the purpose of evaluating the system. Comparing these results produces the accuracy measures shown in Tables~\ref{tbl:truefalse} and \ref{tbl:measures}. While 350 tweets were tagged, the Table~\ref{tbl:truefalse} states a total of 367. This is because many tweets contain more than one software name.

A precision of 79\% is reasonable as this means that 79\% tweets were correctly found to have contained software. 68\% recall is fairly low as this means 32\% of the tweets retrieved from Twitter are actually irrelevant in the sense that they are actually unrelated to software. This could well be an issue with the keywords used, but also perhaps more likely due to the ambiguity associated with many software names, such as \emph{Blender}, which is a 3D computer graphics product as well as a kitchen appliance. The 84\% specificity suggests SWOT is quite successful at identifying negative software matches when processing tweets.

\section{GUI}
The GUI for this system has been implemented to the design requirements stated in Section~\ref{sec:guid}. All pages display a navigation bar allowing access to the Tweet Retrieval subsystem as well as the analysis pages. The home page displays the top ten tweeted software as found by the application. This can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:gui1}. The elements in this list are clickable hyperlinks to their respective analysis pages.

\end{figure}

The search page asks users to enter a single query term as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gui2}. This should ideally be the name of some software, operating system or programming language. After completing this search, the page displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:gui3} shows all retrieved tweets corresponding to the given query term, after being sent through the feature extraction process.

The final requirement is to display the key information to the user. This involves displaying a pie chart representing the sentiment of tweets mentioning the selected software, and is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:gui4} and \ref{fig:gui5}.
