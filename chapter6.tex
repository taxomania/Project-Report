\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{cha:eval}
With implementation and analysis complete, one can now identify and evaluate the key successes and shortcomings of this project. These evaluations have been performed on the basis of the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Does the system work?
\item Is the information found novel and interesting?
\item Is the system easy to use?
\end{itemize}

This process has been carried out by means of independent user evaluations by users of the software.
