\chapter{Design}
\label{cha:design}
This chapter details the overall design of the system to be developed in this project. The software engineering methodology to be used will first be discussed, along with use cases, requirements and the architecture of the system. This will be followed up with notes on the class and database design diagrams. The decisions made with regards to some design choices will also be discussed in more detail.

\section{Methodology}

\section{Use Cases}
There are two main use cases for the proposed system.
