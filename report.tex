\documentclass[12pt]{third-rep}

%% Any characters from a % to the end of line are comments.

%% The third-rep class and this starter kit were written by 
%% Graham Gough <graham@cs.man.ac.uk>
%% If you have any comments or questions regarding this document,
%% please post them to the local newsgroup man.cs.tex.

%% This skeleton report is organised as a master file called
%% report.tex which then includes files for individual parts including
%% abstract.tex, chapter1.tex, chapter2.tex, chapter3.tex and
%% appendix1.tex.  

%% The third-rep style is a locally created style based on the
%% standard LaTeX report style. If you really want to have a look at
%% it, its source can be found in
%% /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/mancs/third-rep.cls
%%
%% More information about LaTeX in general and the local setup in
%% particular can be found on the web at

%%  The best way to latex just one chapter is to uncomment lines such as
%% the next:
%\includeonly{chapter1}

%% This defines the title (the \\ forces a line break)
\title{Text Mining Twitter for Software\\
  and User Perception}
%% and author
\author{Tariq Patel}
%% and supervisor
\supervisor{Dr. Goran Nenadic}
%% and the year of the report
\reportyear{2012}

%% this defines the file that contains the text of the abstract, there
%% must be one of these by the time you submit your report.
\abstractfile{abstract.tex}

%% this defines the file that contains the acknowledgements (it can be
%% omitted if you don't feel like thanking anyone
\thanksfile{merci.tex}

%% End of preamble, the actual document starts here
\begin{document}

%% This actually creates the title and abstract pages
\dotitleandabstract

%% Generate contents etc
\tableofcontents
\listoffigures
\listoftables
\lstlistoflistings

%% These include the actual text
\include{chapter1}
\include{chapter2}
\include{chapter3}
\include{chapter4}
\include{chapter5}
\include{chapter6}
\include{chapter7}
