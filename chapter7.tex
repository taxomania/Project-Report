This chapter discusses the author's reflections on the success and conclusions of the project. Suggestions for further work are made and concludes with a summary of the report. 

\section{Reflections}
In terms of the overall progress made over the course of the year I feel this project has to some extent been a success. It has been a steep learning curve and on that basis some good results have been achieved. However, in absolute terms, I think I have made many mistakes in the way I went about working on the project over the year. This is down to a few key issues.

\textbf{Time management} can be seen as one of the overriding causes of the shortfalls of this project. There were times when progress had completely stalled due to minor issues with implementation.

I also feel as though my \textbf{preparation} may not have been sufficient, as I had overlooked a few key concepts when developing parts of the system. For example, I did not create a training set of data that would ultimately allow me to use a machine learning approach in my system and I think this may have resulted in a slightly lesser performing program, in terms of its accuracy.

However, as previously stated, there have been major strides over the year. I feel I have a much greater grounding in the core object oriented design and programming principles. As well as this, I have developed skills in many new technologies and concepts. This was the first time I have had to develop a multithreaded desktop environment, and I had never previously worked with Python, JSON, MongoDB or the HTTPS protocol. As such I am happy with the general progress made in this project.
